                carried out in unfavorable weather conditions, he showed calm and courage. Contemptuous of danger,

                The Italian Risorgimento was celebrated by a series of medals established by the three sovereigns
                who succeeded each other during the long process of unification of the peninsula: the commemorative
                medal of the campaigns of the wars of independence and the different versions of the commemorative
                medal of the Unification of Italy, which were granted by the Kingdom of Italy to those who had
                participated in the war operations that led to Italian independence and, subsequently, to all those
                who had participated in the First World War, as it was on that occasion that Italian unity was
                traditionally completed with the annexation of Trentino, Venezia Giulia and Istria.
