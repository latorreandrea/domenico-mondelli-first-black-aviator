                Mondelli was in fact, all over the world, the first military aviator of color. A record unfortunately

                claimed by Italy.
                Firstaviator of African ethnicity to obtain the patent of military pilot, first to fly a plane from

                According to the declarations of his adoptive father, Domenico was born in Asmara June
                30,
                1886 with the name
                of Wolde Selassie which could be translated "son of the Trinity", but the true date and place of
                birth have never been ascertained. It happens in unclear circumstances too the meeting with the Parma

                Debaroa in Eritrea, then an Italian colony.
                It's possible, although it has never been proven, that in fact the real father of the child is precisely
                Attilio,
                who had a relationship with an unidentified Abyssinian woman.Indeed Attilio treated him like a son,
                albeit
                for various legal reasons not will be able to officially adopt it.

                Released with the appointment of second lieutenant of the infantry weapon, he was assigned
                to the 5th Bersaglieri Regiment. It is the second time that a black soldier has
                a leadership role over white subordinates, since as early as the mid-800 i
                bersaglieri had had a "dark" captain, Michele Amatore, A photo
                confirms that in the Bersaglieri he had as colleague Achille Starace, future
                secretary of the PNF. Obtained, as established by the civil code of 1865, the
                Italian citizenship in 1907 (21 years), thanks to the condition of
                military.
                He initially served in the 5th Regiment of Bersaglieri then passing in succession to the 7th
                Mondelli served as a lieutenant in the 8th regiment during the war of
                Libya , finally arriving at the 2nd regiment.

                But Domenico's dream is flight. It is not clear how Mondelli has
                developed his aviation passion at a time when military pilots
                they were a few dozen, divided between army and navy.
                The fact is that in this period pioneering Mondelli is interested in the world of aviation and is
                transferred to
                aviators battalion, then commanded by the legendary Maj. Giulio Douhet.

                (28 years old) obtained the pilot's license on a Nieuport-Macchi monoplane: he is the first black
                Italian to
                have it.
                Later he gets the qualification for the Bleriot XI, and on March 30, that of military pilot.
                At the outbreak of the first war world he is captain at the 7th squadron. Aboard his plane he performs
                numerous missions that are worth the first medal of bronze.
                During a reconnaissance, he was hit by artillery shrapnel, and only with its calm and its not
                common cold blood could land in friendly territory.

                With the advent of fascism that forced him to abandon Freemasonry,

                interruptions and delays. His promotion to colonel is canceled, he comes
                placed first in an auxiliary position and then directly outside the staff.

                point of death, officially making him a half-breed Italian. The war hero
                he responds with a long legal battle, with multiple appeals to the War Ministry
                and to the council of state. In 1935-36 the war in Ethiopia and propaganda
                of the Italian empire inevitably increases mistrust and discrimination

                be placed on absolute leave, are placed on extraordinary leave, outside
                from permanent service, with a ban on wearing the uniform: the country for
                who had risked their lives is turning away from them. Mondelli succeeds
                however in December 1936 (at 50) to be promoted to colonel,
                although always in auxiliary. But the circulars issued by fascism in the
                second half of the 1930s, shortly before the publication of the manifesto of the
                race in 1938, clearly indicate how the regime, for a bias
                racist, you do not accept the idea that a black or mestizo Italian can command a
                white Italian military, or have important roles in any area of ​​the

                (on its own initiative). He dies in Rome, near
                the Celio military hospital, on 13 December 1974
                (at 88 years old).

                <strong> Here is a last mystery of a life a
                    constant contact with risk and adventure:</strong> Mondelli had asked to be
                buried at the Verano military shrine, but no evidence of it is found.
                The place of his burial is therefore still unknown today. That which is
                it is clear that in the tomb he carries a medal collection of which any Italian
                could be proud: two silver medals for Military Valor, two medals for
                bronze, a War Merit Cross for Military Valor, the Knight's Cross
                of the Order of the Crown of Italy, the Knight's Cross of the Order of Saints
                Maurizio and Lazzaro, the colonial Order of the Star of Italy and the medal
                commemorative of the Italian-Austrian war.
