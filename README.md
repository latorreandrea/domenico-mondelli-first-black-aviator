### Code Institute Portfolio Project 1: HTML/CSS Essentials
---
Welcome to the first site I'am creating.
The site will be created to testify the skills learned on HTML and CSS with the Code Institute course.

The site will focus on a character from Italian military history: **"Domenico Mondelli"** *(Asmara 30/06/1886 – Rome 13/12/1974)*

Unlike Italian society, the Italian army in its history has not been racist.
In fact, in Italian military history, it is not uncommon to find black people even in the highest ranks.

This aspect of Italian history is not well known (especially among Italians themselves),
and I would like to take advantage of this exam to be able to create a website that talks about a character who,
for history and honors, can be fascinating but that we risk forgetting.
To say one of his firsts it would only be necessary to remember that he was the first black aviator in the history of aviation.
You will be able to find out more [by visiting the site.](https://latorreandrea.github.io/domenico-mondelli-first-black-aviator/)




This is because, even if the Italian army was "inclusive", Italian society, its prejudices, twenty years of fascism plus the simple passage of time have created real black holes in the history of this man.

There are no sites that speak exclusively of Domenico Mondelli, on the internet you can find articles about him taken in part from wikipedia (from which the images and references of the medals and honors were taken), and partly taken from two books:
-Vita del pilota militare Domenico Mondelli (Asmara 30/06/1886 – Roma 13/12/1974 – 88 anni )by Francesco Pezzoli (from this I took inspiration to tell you about his life)
-Il generale nero. Domenico Mondelli: bersagliere, aviatore e ardito, Roma, Ed. Odradek by Mauro Valeri (from this I took pictures).

I hope to make you appreciate a mostly unknown character.
[Enjoy the site!](https://latorreandrea.github.io/domenico-mondelli-first-black-aviator/)

## Strategy

### Project goal: Introduce Domenico Mondelli

The main goal for the website is to build a History website that talks about a character who,
for history and honors, can be fascinating but that we risk forgetting.

Unlike Italian society, the Italian army in its history has not been racist.
In fact, in Italian military history, it is not uncommon to find black people even in the highest ranks.

This aspect of Italian history is not well known (especially among Italians themselves),
To say one of his firsts it would only be necessary to remember that he was the first black aviator in the history of aviation.

#### User goals:
- know more about Domenico Mondelli

The user should be encouraged to find out more about this character, if the site manages to attract him, it can convince him to participate or to report useful events for the community.

If the user is a history expert, he or she can contribute to the knowledge of the community by reporting, through a specific form, any evidence (writings, photos, etc.)

#### Site owner's goal:

The goal of the site is to provide a reliable source of information pertaining to the history of Domenico Mondelli, trying to create a community in which experts and amateurs converge, and can contribute, through evidence, to expand what we know about Domenico Mondelli (as happens for wikipedia).

At the moment there are no sites that speak exclusively of Domenico Mondelli, on the internet you can find articles about him taken in part from:
* **Wikipedia** (from which the images and references of the medals and honors were taken), and partly taken from two books:
* **Vita del pilota militare Domenico Mondelli* (Asmara 30/06/1886 – Roma 13/12/1974 – 88 anni )** by Francesco Pezzoli (from this I took inspiration to tell you about his life)
* **Il generale nero. Domenico Mondelli: bersagliere, aviatore e ardito**, Roma, Ed. Odradek by Mauro Valeri (from this I took pictures).
